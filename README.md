This prototype was submitted for 2022's Global Game Jam!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Druidic Duty"  is a single-player arcade-like chaos management game where you must keep two species in balance, the predators and the prey! The griffons will attack the jackalopes; they can't help it, they need to eat! But if you don't intervene, they'll snack on every single one of those little guys. And don't forget to feed the jackalopes, or they'll starve too. But you don't wanna know what happens when there are TOO many of them, either...

To do this, maneuver carefully through the woods and keep an eye open for trouble! Remember, your goal is to keep both species in perfect balance. Feed the jackalopes with your fruit spell, and use your magical bellow to stun the griffons and shoo away the Jackalopes. If too many attack at once, you can summon a great wall of bushes to keep them away! Go forth, nature's delicate balance is in your paws!
